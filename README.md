Recommendation Systems This is a workshop on using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques to build Recommendation Systesm  

**Theory:** ML &amp; DL Formulation, Prediction vs. Ranking, Similiarity, Biased vs. Unbiased 

**Paradigms:** Content-based, Collaborative filtering, Knowledge-based, Hybrid and Ensembles 

**Data:** Tabular, Images, Text (Sequences) 

**Models:** (Deep) Matrix Factorisation, Auto-Encoders, Wide &amp; Deep, Rank-Learning, Sequence Modelling 

**Methods:** Explicit vs. implicit feedback, User-Item matrix, Embeddings, Convolution, Recurrent, Domain Signals: location, time, context, social, 

**Process:** Setup, Encode &amp; Embed, Design, Train &amp; Select, Serve &amp; Scale, Measure, Test &amp; Improve 

**Tools:** python-data-stack: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras, spacy, implicit, lightfm
